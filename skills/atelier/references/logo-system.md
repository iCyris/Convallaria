# Logo System Workflow

Use this reference for logo concepts, SVG cleanup, lockups, favicon sets, app icons, and platform-specific exports.

## Deliverables

Use `templates/LOGO_SPEC.md` when producing a logo system. A complete logo package should include:

- primary logo
- symbol or mark
- wordmark when relevant
- horizontal, stacked, and compact lockups when relevant
- monochrome, dark-background, and light-background variants
- clear-space and minimum-size rules
- misuse rules
- platform export set

## SVG Source Rules

- Keep SVG source files editable and semantic.
- Preserve a transparent background unless the target platform requires a filled background.
- Use `viewBox` and avoid fixed-only sizing.
- Convert text to outlines only when the user needs portable final artwork and the font cannot be distributed.
- Keep source SVGs in `logo/source/`.

## Raster Export

Use `scripts/rasterize_svg.py` for deterministic PNG export:

```bash
python3 scripts/rasterize_svg.py logo/source/logo.svg --out logo/png --sizes 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
```

The script will use CairoSVG when installed, then fall back to common command-line rasterizers if available.

## Recommended Sizes

| Target | Sizes |
| --- | --- |
| favicon | 16, 32, 48 |
| browser icons | 192, 512 |
| Apple touch icon | 180 |
| iOS app icon source | 1024 |
| macOS app icon source | 1024 |
| Android adaptive icon source | 432 foreground with safe zone |
| social avatar | 512, 1024 |
| Open Graph image | 1200 x 630 |

## QA Checklist

- The logo remains legible at 16 px if used as favicon.
- The mark works on dark and light backgrounds.
- Clear space is defined with a repeatable unit from the logo geometry.
- Exports are named by role and size.
- Every generated asset is listed in `asset-manifest.json`.
