# Asset Export Workflow

Use this reference when packaging multi-file design deliverables for another designer, engineer, or agent.

## Package Shape

```text
brand-pack/
|-- BRAND.md
|-- DESIGN.md
|-- LOGO_SPEC.md
|-- DESIGN_QA.md
|-- asset-manifest.json
|-- tokens/
|-- logo/
|-- images/
|-- screenshots/
`-- handoff/
    |-- developer-handoff.md
    `-- ai-agent-prompt.md
```

Only include files that exist and are relevant to the task.

## Manifest

Use `templates/asset-manifest.json` as the base. The manifest should record:

- project metadata
- source inputs and their role
- generated outputs
- producer subskill or script
- assumptions
- unresolved decisions
- recommended next actions

Validate a manifest with:

```bash
python3 subskills/export/scripts/validate_outputs.py asset-manifest.json
```

## Handoff Writing

A good handoff explains:

- what was produced
- what is the source of truth
- how to use the assets
- what should not be changed casually
- what remains open
- which files another agent should read first

Keep handoff writing practical and production-facing.
