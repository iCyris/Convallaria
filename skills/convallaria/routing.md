# Convallaria Routing Guide

Use this guide when the user's request is mixed, ambiguous, or spans more than one design operation.

## Task Families

| Family | Use when the user asks for | Primary resource | Common outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Refine | extracting style, reverse-engineering visuals, formalizing existing UI, creating tokens from screenshots or code | `subskills/refine/SKILL.md` | `DESIGN.md`, `report.html` |
| Concept | naming, positioning, personality, brand voice, creative direction, visual territories | `subskills/concept/SKILL.md` | `BRAND.md` |
| Logo | logo concepts, SVG cleanup, favicon/app icon export, lockups, clear space | `subskills/logo/SKILL.md` | `LOGO_SPEC.md`, `logo/` |
| Images | compression, conversion, responsive variants, metadata removal | `subskills/images/SKILL.md` | `images/`, `image-manifest.json` |
| Tokens | CSS variables, Tailwind config, Style Dictionary, theme files | `subskills/tokens/SKILL.md` | `tokens/` |
| Audit | screenshot review, design-system compliance, responsive visual checks | `subskills/audit/SKILL.md` | `DESIGN_QA.md`, screenshots |
| Delivery | final manifests, source-of-truth notes, validation, and cross-tool handoff | `shared/handoff.md` | `asset-manifest.json`, `handoff/` |

## Composition Patterns

### From a vague product idea to a usable identity

1. `concept`
2. `logo`
3. `tokens`
4. `shared/handoff.md`

### From screenshots to an implementation-ready design system

1. `refine`
2. `tokens`
3. `audit` if there is an implementation to inspect
4. `shared/handoff.md` for multi-file delivery

### From an SVG logo to platform assets

1. `logo`
2. `images`
3. `shared/handoff.md` for multi-file delivery

### From an existing app to a design audit

1. `refine` if no design system exists
2. `audit`
3. `tokens` if token drift needs repair

## Routing Rules

- Route to the narrowest resource that can complete the task.
- For complete identity work, coordinate `concept`, `logo`, `tokens`, and `shared/handoff.md` instead of routing to an umbrella subskill.
- Load `refine` only for extraction or formalization tasks; it is intentionally large.
- Use scripts for image transforms, SVG rasterization, and manifest validation.
- When multiple subskills are needed, create an `asset-manifest.json` early so each step can append outputs.
- Ask a concise clarifying question only when the target deliverable or source asset is impossible to infer.
